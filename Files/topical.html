        During this semester we have had the privileged to learn about the
        different acspect technology plays in todays soceity, in the course
        Technology & Soceity for programmers <a href="https://student.oslomet.no/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/DATA1100/2021/H%C3%98ST">(DATA1100-1 21H).</a>
        By getting to understand the roll techology have in our soceity, is really important
        since we are the ones going to develop the different tools peoeple
        around the world are going to use. We have writen different reflection
        text about different questions we have covered. Down belowe you will
        find to different task that we have answered and written about the
        topic, "The interplay between technology and society".

          In the video, Hanne Cecilie discusses how a mobile phone can be
          understood as a technical device, a social device, as well as a
          phenomenon that can tell us something about the values in a society. How
          can a mobile phone be understood through the lens of your field of study
          and what do you think are the social implications of it? (From module
          1.1)

        <p class="task1-paragh1">
          Through the lens of our field of study, the mobile phone can be seen as
          a tiny computer. Through this tiny computer we can explore the features
          that form our daily life, like planning, doing tasks “on the go” and
          communicating with peers. For instance, in our study field we use
          learning platforms such as canvas and zoom, which require an internet
          connection. This makes the mobile phone a device quite suited for the
          tasks, since it does not tie the user down to a specific physical place,
          as it can be used from anywhere. However, it does require that the
          device has service and cellular data such as 4G or 5G, or the use of
          internet in a café, or other hotspots.
        </p>

        <p class="task1-paragh2">
          The mobile phone was originally a technical device, but over time it has
          turned into a device more connected to the social aspect of life. Such
          as communicating with our friends and families over any distances within
          a short amount of time. However, this may also impact our ability to be
          social in real life. This gateway into social paradise, can also lead to
          isolation. For instance, if you don’t have the tools necessary, internet
          or a phone, or you decide to not be a part of the change this brings to
          society. This can for example be seen with elderly people that don’t
          follow the evolution of the technology around them, and get overly
          dependent on family, or other means of help, to function in society.
        </p>
  
        <p class="task1-conclusion">
          As a result, the mobile phone can be seen as one of our most important
          devices to our professional and social life.

        The Internet has grown into a ubiquitous infrastructure that societies
        all over the world are increasingly reliant on. To which extent and how
        does the internet have political consequences? Note down some examples
        and discuss with your colleagues. (From module 1.3)

      <p class="task2-paragh1">
        In the last few years we have seen that elections all over the world
        have been influenced by the internet, and have caused consequenses for
        both political and social aspects. A practical example of this is what
        we have seen from the western society, during the American presidential
        election in 2020. Donald Trump both during and after the election used
        his social platforms to undermine the credibility of the election
        result.<a href="https://stacker.com/stories/6057/top-trump-tweets-election-day-2020">(Troyer, 2020)</a> 
        Which may have resulted in the attack on Capitol Hill 6th of
        January 2021, were Trump supporters stormed Capitol Hill to stop the
        formalization of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack">(Wikipedia, 2021)</a> 
        This shows the power behind big political influencers skepticisms towards the
        government and other means of power.

      <p class="task2-paragh2">
        Seeing it from the eastern society perspective could be the Myanmar coup
        in February 2021. After the military took over February 1st, access to
        internet and social media was gradually more restricted, culminating in
        the complete shutdown of the web on the 2nd of April 2021. This makes it
        difficult for the civil people of Myanmar to know what’s going on in the
        country at large, and to actively participate in the demonstrations. The
        bans on social media, especially Facebook, also deeply affects people’s
        ability to communicate with one another.<a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/MYANMAR-POLITICS/INTERNET-RESTRICTION/rlgpdbreepo/ ">(Tostevin et al., 2017)</a>
        One of many consequences of this is that people outside of Myanmar will get biased information when
        the people themselves have no means of communicating with us.
      </p>

      <p class="task2-conclusion">
        To conclude, both examples show how restricted flow of information can
        influence individuals or as a whole group, whether it’s chosen our
        forced upon them.
