      <h1>Technology & Society</h1>
      <p>
        During this semester we have had the privileged to learn about the
        different acspect technology plays in todays soceity, in the course
        Technology & Soceity for programmers (DATA1100-1 21H). By getting to
        understand the roll techology have in our soceity, is really important
        since we are the ones going to develop the different tools peoeple
        around the world are going to use. We have writen different reflection
        text about different questions we have covered. Down belowe you will
        find to different task that we have answered and written about the
        topic, "The interplay between technology and society".

      <h2>The interplay between technology and society</h2>
      <p class="task1-description">
        Task 1, Module 1.1 In the video, Hanne Cecilie discusses how a mobile
        phone can be understood as a technical device, a social device, as well
        as a phenomenon that can tell us something about the values in a
        society. How can a mobile phone be understood through the lens of your
        field of study and what do you think are the social implications of it?
        (From module 1.1)

      <p class="task1-pargh1">
        Through the lens of our field of study, the mobile phone can be seen as
        a tiny computer. Through this tiny computer we can explore the features
        that form our daily life, like planning, doing tasks “on the go” and
        communicating with peers. For instance, in our study field we use
        learning platforms such as canvas and zoom, which require an internet
        connection. This makes the mobile phone a device quite suited for the
        tasks, since it does not tie the user down to a specific physical place,
        as it can be used from anywhere. However, it does require that the
        device has service and cellular data such as 4G or 5G, or the use of
        internet in a café, or other hotspots. 
        
       <p class="task1-pargh2"> The mobile phone was originally a technical device, but over time it has turned into a device more
        connected to the social aspect of life. Such as communicating with our
        friends and families over any distances within a short amount of time.
        However, this may also impact our ability to be social in real life.
        This gateway into social paradise, can also lead to isolation. For
        instance, if you don’t have the tools necessary, internet or a phone, or
        you decide to not be a part of the change this brings to society. This
        can for example be seen with elderly people that don’t follow the
        evolution of the technology around them, and get overly dependent on
        family, or other means of help, to function in society.</p>
        
        <p class="task1-conclusion"> As a result, the mobile phone can be seen as one of our most important devices to our
        professional and social life.
