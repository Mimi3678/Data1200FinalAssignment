            <p><h2>Text about overall learning about code</h2></p>
            <p>During this semester we have learnt about html & css and java. 
                These courses are from skratch, so we started off really 
                basic in both of these subjects.

                <h3>From upper secondary school to university</h3>
                <p>For us, Miriam and Mats going from already studying was a 
                    soft transition when it comes to already having the study 
                    techniques in.

                <h3>From work-life to university</h3>
                <p>Both Ylva and Siri have been in the work-life before going 
                    to the university. Going from work life to university it 
                    was hard to keep up with the schedule already made when 
                    the university is as open as it is. At work we had to go 
                    to 8am, and the day ended at 5pm. At university this is 
                    different in its way of needing to be very independent.
