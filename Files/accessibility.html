                <p>The purpose of this page is to show the tests we did and how we made our website as accessible as possible in response to these tests.
                    We checked the website on 
                <a href=" https://wave.webaim.org/ " target="_blank">webmaim.org</a>
                    (From now on referred to as C1 (Checker1) and

                <hr>
                <p>We found contrast error on all pages with our header text. (C2) We believe that this comes from the website-checker pushing the text further down than it should be. Since the gap doesn’t exist on our page, when we use it, since the text is on top of the picture. We believe that changing the color so that the checker is happy, would actually create a bigger contrast error.

                <h3>Home:</h3>
                <p>The only problem C1 found on our homepage was the contrast issue, that will happen on all pages. 
                </p>

                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>The problems C1 and C2 found on this page was that we didn’t have alternative text for our images. This was an easy fix, so we added the alt text. Same goes for the justified text that C1 also found on the reflection page, we made it aligned from the left.
                </p>

                <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
                <p>Both C1 and C2 found the problem that none of the pictures on the accessibility page had alt text. We kept that in mind for when we were gonna put information in the page, not just placeholders, since the test was done on the page before we put in any of this information.
                </p>

                <h3>Topical:</h3>
                <p>C1 had an alert to where our alt text on our images was the same as the text right beneath the images.</p>

                <h3>Color blindness:</h3>
                <p>We saw a problem with some color-blindness on our topical page, the blue links were hard to see. We thought about contrasts on each page, but with this we became more aware of this problem throughout the pages. We countered this by making them highlight in white when hovered, to make the contrast bigger.

                <p>For our main page we decided to have a slideshow of pictures. We chose this method to show pictures as it allowed us to show several pictures in a small area. The pictures change automatically after 8 seconds, as we mean that this is how long it takes to read the text associated with the pictures. </p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>For our reflection page we used several divs to make the layout. In these we used several paragraphs and images, to make the text go around the images we used float. We also choose to use hover on some of the images as this makes the page more interactive for the user. </p>
            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>On our accessibility page we chose to use a grid layout, as this is something none of us have used before and we wanted to challenge ourselves. We tried using several divs and float on this page at first, but found the grid to be more fitting. We chose not to use the grid layout on the mobile size, here we used the first layout we went for. </p>
            <h3>Topical</h3>
            <p>On our topical page we had two different texts, so we decided to put in their own divs. These divs were then put in a container-div, to make it easier for us to get the layout we wanted. We used float on the big and middle screen size, as well as vertical-align, to get them to start at the same place and be next to each other. We decided to remove float on the small screen, so everything would be underneath each other.</p>
